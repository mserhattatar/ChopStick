# Chopsticks Hand Game

## It is still in progress

For this game there are problems with finger movements. I am still working on it


Chopsticks is a strategy game and considered under combinatorial game theory (CGT) which is a branch of mathematics and theoretical computer science. CGT game theory has been largely confined to two-player games that have a position in which the players take turns changing in defined ways or moves to achieve a defined winning condition[1].

Chopsticks game is played with 2 players. Here are the main rules:

1. Each player begins with one finger raised on each hand.
2. On a player's turn, they must either attack, split or merge, but one thing at a turn.
3. To attack, a player uses one of their live hands to strike an opponent's live hand. The number of fingers on the opponent's struck hand will increase by the number of fingers on the hand used to strike.
4. To split, a player strikes their own two hands together, and transfers raised fingers from one hand to the other as desired. 
5. To merge, a player merges the fingers on both hands to one of the hands.
6. A player may revive their own dead hand using a split.
7. If any hand of any player reaches more than five fingers, then five fingers are subtracted from that hand.
8. If a hand reaches 5 fingers it is considered a "dead hand".
9. A player wins once all opponents are eliminated (by each having two dead hands at once).
10. There is no variation in which a player can kill their own hand.[2]


There will be single player and multiple player options in the game. Single player plays agains the Artificial Intelligience.
